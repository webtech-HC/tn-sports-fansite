## Editorial / Fair Use (Names & Facts)
We use team and opponent names only as necessary to identify games and coverage—this is standard editorial/nominative use.

Facts (e.g., dates, times, scores, standings) are not copyrightable. Our page layout, design, and code are our own.

## Trademarks & Branding
We do **not** use UT/SEC/NCAA logos, wordmarks, or proprietary brand elements (e.g., the “Power T,” official lockups, or mascot art).

Our site name, domain, and visual style are designed to avoid implying endorsement.

## Player Names, Photos & NIL
References to players in news/editorial context are allowed.

We do not use a player’s name, image, or likeness to promote products/services without permission.

If you are an athlete or representative and have a concern, contact **[legal@yourdomain.com](mailto:legal@yourdomain.com)**.

We publish original photos, commissioned/licensed assets, or properly attributed Creative Commons/stock.

We do **not** repost broadcast footage, game stills, or third-party media without rights.

## Schedules, Scores & Sources
Schedules, kickoff times, and TV assignments can change. We label times **TBA** when uncertain and update as announcements are made.

Data is compiled from public announcements and/or permitted APIs; scraping sources that prohibit it is not allowed.
